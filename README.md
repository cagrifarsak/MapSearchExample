# MapSearchExample


I developed a four-page app for the map search example. 

A search can be made from the search bar at the top of the opening screen and results are displayed with the completion feature. When one of the results is clicked, it zooms into that result on the map and assigns a marker. When the marker is clicked, it is directed to the detail page. You can click on the picture on the detail page and save it to your favorites. You can also switch to the favorites screen from the button at the bottom.

Developed with Swift language.
I used XCode 13.4.1
Developed with MVVM architecture.
Except for dynamic areas, I used autolayout and storyboard in the design.
I wanted to add a few tests that can serve as an example for test writing, which I know is one of the main focus points that I need to develop for myself.
